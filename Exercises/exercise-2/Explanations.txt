1. React
React is a framework for web development. You take advantage of components and some other functionalities to
reduce development time and to increase responsiveness and interactibility with the website.

2. React Component
A React Component is a piece of code that you can reuse and use like any other tag in HTML.
You can make abstract behavior and pass the information when programatically.

3. Single-page application
A Single-page application is an application where you don't need to refresh at all.
React does this by changing the content of the page dynamically through navigators

4. Declarative programming (versus imperative programming)
The most common way to differentiate the two is that Declarative Programming describes "WHAT" you do and Imperative Programming
describes "HOW" you do it.
The important thing to understand is that declarative programming relies on the underlying imperative programming. Declarative
programming allows you to perform actions that have been abstracted and simplified.

5. JSX
JSX is an addition to JS that allows you to define elements in the same way that you code HTML. This allows you to design the UI
very quickly and in a way most web developers are already familiar with.

6. Asynchronous (versus synchronous)
Synchronous is a practice where each instruction must be completed for the next one to start.
Asynchronous allows you to run multiple things at once and skip ahead of code that should be running in the background
without pausing the execution of the rest of the program.
